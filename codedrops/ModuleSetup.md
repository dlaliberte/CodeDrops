# Module Setup CodeDrop

## Requirements
- Import necessary modules and libraries integral for the extractor functionality.
- Maintain logical grouping for standard vs. external dependencies.
- Facilitate adjustments for adding or removing module dependencies.

## Design
- Organize imports: standard library, external libraries.
- Enable replacement or mocking during tests (e.g., `argparse` for CLI operations).

## Implementation
```python
import re
import os
import sys
import argparse
from enum import Enum
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Tuple, Union
from datetime import datetime
```

## Testing
- Verify imports are correctly included and are accessible.
- Ensure external libraries are installed and compatible.

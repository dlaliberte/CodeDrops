# High-Level Design for Hierarchical CodeDrops

## Requirements
- Define functionalities for extracting code sections into parts
- Compose code sections back into logical groups
- Allow constructing a full CodeDrop from parts
- Enable decomposition of composed units into parts

## Design

### SectionExtraction
- Parse CodeDrop documents and separate sections based on types
- Store each section in organized files
- Ensure all section types are covered (Requirements, Design, Implementation, etc.)

### UnitComposition
- Collect related sections/files and combine them into larger units
- Support logical grouping such as classes or modules
- Maintain dependencies and proper ordering

### CodeDropConstruction
- Assemble extracted parts back into a comprehensive CodeDrop
- Restore original section orders and formatting
- Provide options for customization during construction

### UnitDecomposition
- Break down composed units into smaller parts/files
- Identify logical subdivisions such as methods, attributes, etc.
- Support reusability and modular design principles

### Transformation Mapping and Flow

1. **`SectionExtraction`**: Extract sections from a CodeDrop → Output as files organized by section type.
2. **`UnitComposition`**: Combine related files into modules/classes → Formulate cohesive units ready for execution.
3. **`CodeDropConstruction`**: Reconstruct a CodeDrop from individual files → Achieve a complete, integrated document.
4. **`UnitDecomposition`**: Divide units into smaller functional segments → Generate fine-grained components available for reuse.
